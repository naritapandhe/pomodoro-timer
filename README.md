### Overview
---
* An attempt to boost my productivity, I have developed this timer based on the Pomodoro technique. Main premise behind this technique is to work in blocks of time.

* Throughout the day, you budget your time into short increments and take breaks periodically. You work for 25 minutes, then take break for five minutes.

* This web application is developed using: [Yii2 - PHP based MVC framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-index.html) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/). 
If your time management strategy uses longer focussed bursts, you can customize the time blocks as well!
